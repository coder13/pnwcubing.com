            My name is Joylyn Davis and my oldest son, Ethan, has been going to
            speedcubing competitions for about 3 years now. We have been to over
            [50] competitions to date and I am here to answer any questions you
            may have about the community overall, competitions, and anything
            else that you can think of. We found competitions through YouTube
            videos and Ethan really wanted to go to one. When we arrived we
            didn&apos;t know what to expect. I was worried that my introverted
            child would melt and this would be a horrible social experience.
            Instead what we found was a group of people who were very welcoming
            and supportive. We ended up staying the entire day just so that he
            could talk with other cubers and hang out. I saw my son talk and
            laugh with people he had just met. I have decided to try and support
            this community in whatever way I can because of all that they have
            given to our family.

          <p>
            <b>Q</b>: My kid&apos;s times are not that great, should we go to a
            competition?
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>A</b>: Yes. A big part of the comps is the social aspect that
            takes place in between their competing. That is when they learn new
            techniques and hear about different types of cubes and make friends.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Q</b>: My kid is really not social and super introverted. I am
            worried there will be way too many people and they will hate it.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>A</b>: A good 90% of the other people (parents included) at that
            comps will also be introverted and not fond of social situations.
            That all changes when they come together to talk about cubes and
            cubing.
          </p>

          <p>
            <b>Q</b>: Why does my kid want to get to the competition so early?
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>A</b>: It may be that they are just super excited. It may also be
            so that they can get a spot at a table so that they can practice
            before they compete. As a parent you and other spectators should try
            to leave the table spots for the competitors. At every competition
            there are chairs for spectators and that is the best place for you
            to sit.
          </p>

          <p>
            <b>Q</b>: Can I drop my kid off at the competition and come back
            later?
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>A</b>: The delegate and organizer(s) are not responsible for
            keeping track of minors during the competition. I would say if you
            drove with your kid then you should stay with them. Yes, you can run
            out for a short time and come back. A competitor can be disqualified
            and asked to leave the venue for bad behavior. This can also lead to
            the competitor being banned from competing for a period of time.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Q</b>: Who is in charge of a competition?
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>A</b>: There is always at least one WCA (World Cube Association)
            delegate present. They make final decisions on things like +2 or if
            someone gets an additional solve. They are also the ones who pass on
            the official results to the WCA so that stats and records are
            official. There is also an organizer. At times the delegate and
            organizer is the same person. Both will have a lot of information
            about the event and are a great resource. If you would like to
            familiarize yourself with the local delegates, you can do so on the
            Delegates tab!
          </p>

          <p>
            <b>Q</b>: How can I help at a comp when I donâ€™t know how to solve a
            cube?
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>A</b>: There are a couple of different ways that anyone can help.
            The first is to go up and help judge. During the first rounds there
            are competitors assigned to help and judge but later rounds do not
            have anyone assigned. This is a great way to help keep the
            competition running on time. There is always a judging tutorial and
            you can always ask someone to walk you through what you need to do.
            You can also help by being a runner. This is more for those who have
            been to a few competitions and understand the basics of what goes
            on. There are also fewer runners needed than judges. This involves
            taking unsolved cubes to the scrambling table, taking scrambled
            cubes to the stations, calling competitors to a station, and taking
            solved cubes back to the scrambling table.
          </p>

          <p>
            <b>Q</b>: My kid wants to be a scrambler, how do I help them?
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>A</b>: Scramblers are decided by the delegate before the
            competition begins. They are usually more experienced cubers who
            have been to several competitions and are known to be reliable and
            fast. This is something that your cuber may be asked to do at some
            point but I would encourage them to enjoy competing and to help with
            judging.
          </p>

          <p>
            <b>Q</b>: How fair are the scrambles and how does that work?
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>A</b>: Scrambles are generated randomly from a piece of software.
            Everyone in the same group will get the same scrambles. Also every
            round has different scrambles so that there are no repeat scrambles
            throughout the competition. The delegate does not even look at the
            scrambles in advance because they also often are competing as well.
